# Leave GitHub

GitHub's CEO has helpfully pointed out how you need to ["embrace AI or get out"](https://www.businessinsider.com/github-ceo-developers-embrace-ai-or-get-out-2025-8). I personally doubt AI is so useful if executives need to use these weird, out of touch scare tactics to shove it down our throats, so this account exists solely out of necessity and doesn't host any of my actual code. Check [here](https://git.arielaw.ar/arisunz) for that.

[GitHub is an "AI platform" first, git server second](https://www.theregister.com/2025/08/11/github_head_ankles_as_microsoft/).

Consider migrating to free and open alternatives like [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) or even self-hosting a personal [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) instance, it's WAY easier than it seems! ðŸ’•
